### Personal Philosophy 
   
My personal philosophy includes the commitment to be a lifelong learner, educator, and patient advocate. I am dedicated to caring for every patient and family member holistically including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of wellbeing. I believe that nursing embraces quality patient-centered care through compassion, empathy, and advocacy. These traits establish a healing atmosphere emphasizing education and health promotion to achieve peak patient wellbeing. Nursing is a work of the heart, the perfect blend of art and science. I’m called to nursing because satisfies my desire to make the world a better place through the care of others.

My short-term goals are to increase my knowledge and confidence with patient care. I aim to reach my goals through an open mind, patience, humility, and solid critical thinking skills. To increase my knowledge, I am committed to remaining curious and will seek out wisdom from more experienced nurses. I will never shy away from asking questions and will embrace constructive criticism. I strive to provide high-quality care for my patients by creating solid therapeutic relationships built on genuine understanding and trust. 

My strengths from the Clifton Strength Finder Assessment include intellection, learner, empathy, developer and responsibility. I appreciate intellectual activity and am able to streamline processes, offer new ideas, suggest different perspectives and customarily reach conclusions. As a learner, I am driven by the desire to grow and continuously improve my nursing practice. Empathy allows me to build a trusting connection with patients and strengthens communication through understanding. I encourage and value others by recognizing their efforts and successes. Lastly, I provide high-quality, honest, reliable care and set a good example for others.  

My long-term goals are to complete my Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Certification and master’s degree. I am dedicated to raising awareness and reducing the stigma for those suffering from mental health issues. I will reach my goals through my passion and drive to make a positive difference in the lives of my patients.
