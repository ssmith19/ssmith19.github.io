### QSEN COMPENTENCIES

| PATIENT CENTERED CARE  | QUALITY IMPROVEMENT |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Patient-centered care is the heart of holistic nursing practice in which physical, psychological, spiritual, and social dimensions are considered. Patients are seen as more than a disease process or medical record number; they are viewed as real human beings. Patient-centered-care values and respects the patients’ needs and preferences which allows for patients to play active role in clinical decisions. The multidisciplinary team must partner with the patient and family throughout the care process and actively collaborate with one another. Each patient is unique and therefore care should not be provided in a “one size fits all” fashion. Individual needs drive a comprehensive care plan and provide the benchmark for evaluation of effective care. If successful, patient-centered care can improve quality of care, increase patient and staff satisfaction, and reduce costs of care.   | Quality improvement increases patient safety by promoting quality healthcare. It ensures that all members of the healthcare team are working together to provide optimum care for patients. Quality improvement systems are designed to test changes to continuously improve the safety and quality of patient care. A small test of change in daily work using an experimental learning method such as Plan-Do-Study-Act Data can be used to initiate change processes at the local level. Quality improvement uses data to monitor the outcomes of care processes and provides valuable information about specific populations. In the occurrence of an adverse event, hospitals need to conduct a root cause analysis to investigate the incident and research prevention strategies. Nurses must evaluate performance and utilize various tools such as control charts to understand variations in care. Local change must be valued, both the individual and team roles in the change process must be recognized. Gaps between local and best practices must be assessed to ensure care is provided at the highest evidence-based level.|
|	In clinical practice I assess patients not only physically but spiritually, mentally, and emotionally. I recognize the dynamic interchange of domains that impact health and wellbeing. It is important to treat patients beyond a diagnosis and care for the whole person. Care, compassion, and patience are central to a patient-centered care approach. As a future healthcare provider, I will continue to advocate for and engage patients with their care. This will foster confidence and promote an optimal state of health and wellbeing.| In clinical practice, I have exercised quality improvement with the use of flow charts, checklists, and cause-effect diagrams. The use of these tools allows for safety and transparency in patient care processes. I understand that quality improvement is a continuous process that is an essential part of daily work. As a future healthcare provider, I will improve the quality of care by analyzing data of patient outcomes and evaluating performance including for variations.  I will initiate quality improvement projects and continue to research the latest National Quality Standards to achieve a highest evidence-based level of care.  |

| SAFETY  | TEAMWORK & COLLABORATION |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Safety is paramount in nursing practice. It includes not only minimizing and preventing harm to patients, but for other healthcare personnel as well. Nurses are essential in the surveillance and synergism that reduce adverse patient events. It is important for nurses to be aware of human factors and commonly used unsafe practices that contribute to a hazardous care environment. Dangerous abbreviations, workarounds, lack of communication, and an over reliance on memory are key contributors of unsafe practices. To minimize unsafe practices a culture of safety must be established through the use of technology, checklists, open communication, and standardized error reporting systems. A culture of safety also includes being aware of one’s surroundings, not over relying on technology, and questioning anything that may not seem “right.” To further develop safety skills healthcare professionals must utilize valuable resources such as the national patient safety guidelines and initiatives.|Teamwork and Collaboration in healthcare are critical to provide effective, safe, and quality patient care. Collaboration incorporates high levels of mutual respect, open communication, and joint decision making.  Effective collaboration involves commitment to a common goal, shared feedback, and constructive disagreements among parties.  Multidisciplinary teamwork encourages open-ended discussion and active problem-solving through shared leadership roles. Team members must be aware of their own strengths and weaknesses to successfully contribute to the common purpose or goal. Regardless of the role within the healthcare team, individuals are united by the overall goal to deliver optimal patient-centered care.|
|In clinical practice, I have increased safety by participating in hourly patient rounding, using checklists, following the medication administration rights, maintaining seizure and fall precautions, and asking for help when needed. I understand the importance of being accountable for mistakes that do occur and promptly reporting them. As a future healthcare provider, I will maintain safe practices by keeping up to date with the latest national safety campaigns and remaining critical of my own care performance. I will continue to promote a culture of safety and hold myself to a high standard of care to minimize harm to patients and the healthcare team. |In clinical practice, I promote collaboration by employing effective communication with all members of the interdisciplinary healthcare team. I understand my personal strengths and weaknesses as well as the importance of asking for help when it is needed. As a future healthcare provider, I will continue to foster a collaborative environment by showing others respect and participating in shared decision making. I believe that a true team effort is the cornerstone to high quality, safe patient-centered care. |

| EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE  | INFORMATICS |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Evidence-based practice (EBP) integrates the most current evidence into clinical practice. EBP allows for individualized care for patients and improves health outcomes. It includes three main components: research evidence, clinical expertise, and patient/family values. The scientific method is utilized in EBP process to differentiate clinical opinion from research and evidence summaries. EBP focuses on patient-centered care and aims to optimize routine approaches to care with less than superior outcomes. Nurses must value the need for continuous clinical improvement based on the latest research and knowledge. This involves discriminating between valid and invalid reasons for modifying EBP and identifying the strengths of available research. The health care system relies on EBP to determine the best clinical practices in order to provide optimal patient care.| Informatics streamlines communication and facilitates continuity of care. It allows members of the healthcare team to efficiently collaborate, manage knowledge, improve patient safety, and make decisions. Our healthcare system is dynamic; technology plays an important role in both nursing education and clinical practice. In today’s world, nurses are using technology more frequently and have the most communication with patients. Technology and information are essential to providing safe patient care. Thus, it is essential that nurses are able to accurately document patient information and are proficient in computer systems. Informatics, if applied successfully, can help improve patient outcomes, minimize errors, and increase overall productivity.|
|In clinical practice, I implement EBP by questioning current routine practices and participating in a work environment that facilitates the integration of new evidence into standard practice. I understand the importance of continuous improvement to deliver superior individualized health care. As a future healthcare provider, I will maintain a spirit of inquiry to identify knowledge gaps, formulate relevant questions, and critically analyze current evidence on best practices. I will continue to promote a culture of curiosity and will remain up to date with the latest EBP to improve patient outcomes. | In clinical practice, I use informatics to improve patient safety by utilizing barcode scanning systems during medication administration, automated IV pumps to control fluids/medications dosages and drips, and when analyzing electronic health records. Informatics can help to reduce human error and adds an extra safety check. However, I acknowledge that technology is not free of error, it is important to always double check all processes to ensure optimal patient safety. For example, though the bar code scanning system eases the medication administration process, it is not a replacement for the rights of medication administration. As a future healthcare provider, I will continue to use technology to provide safe, effective care to patients.|
