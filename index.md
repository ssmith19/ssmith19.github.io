### Personal Philosophy 
   
My personal philosophy includes the commitment to be a lifelong learner, educator, and patient advocate. I am dedicated to caring for every patient and family member holistically including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of wellbeing. I believe that nursing embraces quality patient-centered care through compassion, empathy, and advocacy. These traits establish a healing atmosphere emphasizing education and health promotion to achieve peak patient wellbeing. Nursing is a work of the heart, the perfect blend of art and science. I’m called to nursing because satisfies my desire to make the world a better place through the care of others.

My short-term goals are to increase my knowledge and confidence with patient care. I aim to reach my goals through an open mind, patience, humility, and solid critical thinking skills. To increase my knowledge, I am committed to remaining curious and will seek out wisdom from more experienced nurses. I will never shy away from asking questions and will embrace constructive criticism. I strive to provide high-quality care for my patients by creating solid therapeutic relationships built on genuine understanding and trust. 

My strengths from the Clifton Strength Finder Assessment include intellection, learner, empathy, developer and responsibility. I appreciate intellectual activity and am able to streamline processes, offer new ideas, suggest different perspectives and customarily reach conclusions. As a learner, I am driven by the desire to grow and continuously improve my nursing practice. Empathy allows me to build a trusting connection with patients and strengthens communication through understanding. I encourage and value others by recognizing their efforts and successes. Lastly, I provide high-quality, honest, reliable care and set a good example for others.  

My long-term goals are to complete my Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Certification and master’s degree. I am dedicated to raising awareness and reducing the stigma for those suffering from mental health issues. I will reach my goals through my passion and drive to make a positive difference in the lives of my patients. 


### QSEN COMPENTENCIES

| PATIENT CENTERED CARE  | QUALITY IMPROVEMENT |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Patient-centered care is the heart of holistic nursing practice in which physical, psychological, spiritual, and social dimensions are considered. Patients are seen as more than a disease process or medical record number; they are viewed as real human beings. Patient-centered-care values and respects the patients’ needs and preferences which allows for patients to play active role in clinical decisions. The multidisciplinary team must partner with the patient and family throughout the care process and actively collaborate with one another. Each patient is unique and therefore care should not be provided in a “one size fits all” fashion. Individual needs drive a comprehensive care plan and provide the benchmark for evaluation of effective care. If successful, patient-centered care can improve quality of care, increase patient and staff satisfaction, and reduce costs of care.   | Quality improvement increases patient safety by promoting quality healthcare. It ensures that all members of the healthcare team are working together to provide optimum care for patients. Quality improvement systems are designed to test changes to continuously improve the safety and quality of patient care. A small test of change in daily work using an experimental learning method such as Plan-Do-Study-Act Data can be used to initiate change processes at the local level. Quality improvement uses data to monitor the outcomes of care processes and provides valuable information about specific populations. In the occurrence of an adverse event, hospitals need to conduct a root cause analysis to investigate the incident and research prevention strategies. Nurses must evaluate performance and utilize various tools such as control charts to understand variations in care. Local change must be valued, both the individual and team roles in the change process must be recognized. Gaps between local and best practices must be assessed to ensure care is provided at the highest evidence-based level.|
| Content Cell  | In clinical practice, I have exercised quality improvement with the use of flow charts, checklists, and cause-effect diagrams. The use of these tools allows for safety and transparency in patient care processes. I understand that quality improvement is a continuous process that is an essential part of daily work. As a future healthcare provider, I will improve the quality of care by analyzing data of patient outcomes and evaluating performance including for variations.  I will initiate quality improvement projects and continue to research the latest National Quality Standards to achieve a highest evidence-based level of care.  |
